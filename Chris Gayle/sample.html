            <blockquote>Christopher Henry Gayle OD (born 21 September 1979) is a Jamaican cricketer
            who has been playing international cricket for the West Indies since 1999.[5] Nicknamed 
            "The Universe Boss", Gayle is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most destructive 
            batsmen to have played Twenty20 cricket, and by some as the best ever.[6][7] He played a crucial role in the West Indies teams that won the 2004
            ICC Champions Trophy,2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC World Twenty20. </blockquote>
